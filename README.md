What Is An Event?

- Simply put, an event is a message that the Window Server (described below) sends to an application in response to some action taken by the user. 
- Pressing a key on the keyboard generates an event, as does releasing that same key. Pressing the mouse button in a window generates an event, as does releasing the mouse button (and moving the mouse).
